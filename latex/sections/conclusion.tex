Future works: 
- Dropout rate to prevent overfitting
- See if data could predict relapse (because relapse in bc is more deadly than the initial diagnosis)

Issues: 
- NN is a black box, diagnosticians need to understand how something works in order to use it in real life.

On BC data

We had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 1 on our neural network, which we consider a great success. However, we recognize the limitation of our model and are generally critical to the implementation of "black boxes" in clinical settings. Although the tool can definitely be used to aid diagnosticians in diagnosis, the more time-extensive task of the process of diagnosis is perhaps collecting the nuclei annotation data that's needed. Future work on the classifier could therefore include simplification of this task, by creating a feature extractor to handle new samples.
