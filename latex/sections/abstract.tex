%------------------------- Abstract -----------------------------
%================================================================
% You summarize your work short and sweet, and reveal very sensible findings. Good! For an abstract, it is customary to include some stage setting at the beginning. The first sentence should reveal what field we are in. The next few might narrow in on which specific subfield we are in. Then, you explain your motivation, or present the "gap" in knowledge that your research will fill.

% Of course, it's not easy to make a motivation for this project, because it is just a project! But I encourage you to attempt to create a motivation that corresponds to the results you want to highlight here. For example, maybe you see a need to explore when to use OLS versus Ridge, because OLS performs better than Ridge unless there's overfitting. It's up to you :) 


% The abstract can then conclude with the broader impact of your findings. What does it mean for the scientific community? Or the general public?
