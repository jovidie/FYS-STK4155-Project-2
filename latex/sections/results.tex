\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
% Present results and give a critical discussion of my work in 
% the context of other work. Relate the work to previous studies, 
% and make sure the results are reproducible. Include information 
% in figure captions such that they can give the reader enough to 
% understand the main gist of the report.

\subsection{Gradient descent}

We applied the gradient descent algorithm to data simulated from a third-degree polynomial without noise to investigate how quickly it converged to the true parameters 

- describe implementation\\
- Show all the different optimizers etc\\
- compare to regression from last project\\
- Based on this, we chose to keep this and this optimizer\\
- include figure of terrain, compare to ridge from last project and data\\



\subsection{Regression analysis with FFNN}

- compare to project 1\\
- discuss results compared to OLS/Ridge\\
- Optimal learning rates and parameters, lambda-learningrate grid-search\\
- discuss activation functions\\
- discuss initialization of learning rates\\


\subsection{Breast cancer data}
- A couple of sentences on choosing optimizer
- Classification and accuracy of binary classification\\
- Discuss the results and analyze the different parameters used (learning rate, lambda) and the effect of different activation functions\\
- Compare with similar code from Scikit-Learn etc.\\
- Compare with logistic regression\\



Future works: 
- Dropout rate to prevent overfitting
-
