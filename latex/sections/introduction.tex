The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are many-faceted and a hot topic in most fields
of industry and science today. Although the concept of AI is old, it has recently regained popularity during the current AI boom, 
which began in 2010 by a combination of advances in the field of deep learning. 

Deep learning is a sub-category of machine learning that uses 
artificial neural networks to make informed decisions about a dataset. These artificial neural networks (ANN) get their name from 
the process which they are thought to simulate; neurons in the brain that communicate through a shared network. 

The concept of machine intelligence was presented for the first time when Turing presented his idea of 
a Turing machine in 1936 \cite{turing_36}, a machine that was supposed to mimic human intelligence. However the actual idea of brain mimicry and ANN's is considered to first be proposed by McCullough and Pitts in 1943 \cite{mccu_pitt}.

In this project, we create an artificial neural network from scratch, as well as a model for logistic regression and a set of optimizers 
in order to explore how our ANN compares to simpler logistic regression models. We also explore how our ANN compares to previously 
explored linear regression methods from Project 1. Finally, we use our ANN on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to predict if a
tumor is bening or malignant. 

We found that ...
