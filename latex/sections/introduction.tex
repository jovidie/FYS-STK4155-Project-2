A major issue across the world today is the lack of physicians in any field of medicine. The access to physician is determined by the 
density in each country, with ranges from $52$ per $10 0000$ in Norway to $1.7$ per $10 000$ in Zimbabwe \cite{who_physicians}. Needless to say, 
the access to expert physicians in any field is even lower and countries with low densities of physicians or expert physicians need better
solutions. 

One example of specialist shortage is the global issue with shortage on hisptopathologist. They are experts in diagnosing 
diseases based on tissue sample slides. Computational scientists combined forces with histopathologist to create computer-aided 
diagnosis (CAD) systems where they use deep learning such as convultional neural networks (CNN) or vision transformers (ViT)
to train models that can pre-label massive amounts of data, in order to help with faster diagnosis \cite{histopath_AI}.

Artificial neural networks are 

In this project, we create an artificial neural network (ANN) with five different optimizers, and we explore how the ANN performs on the 
Whisconsin Breast Cancer data set. The dataset is a benchmark for classification of breast cancer, and is commonly used to test machine learning 
classification methods. We also compare our ANN to logistic regression to see how models with different levels of complexity perform on the same data. 

In this project, we create an artificial neural network from scratch, as well as a model for logistic regression and a set of optimizers 
in order to explore how our ANN compares to simpler or similar logistic regression models. We also explore how our ANN compares to previously 
explored linear regression methods from Project 1. Finally, we use our ANN on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to predict if a
tumor is bening or malignant.
