@ARTICLE{mccu_pitt,
  title     = "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity",
  author    = "McCulloch, Warren S and Pitts, Walter",
  abstract  = "Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity,
               neural events and the relations among them can be treated by
               means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of
               every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of
               more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and
               that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions,
               one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is
               shown that many particular choices among possible
               neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that
               for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists
               another net which behaves under the other and gives the same
               results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various
               applications of the calculus are discussed.",

  abstract = {On-line first-order backpropagation is sufficiently fast and effective for many large-scale classification problems but for very high precision mappings, batch processing may be the method of choice. This paper reviews first- and second-order optimization methods for learning in feedforward neural networks. The viewpoint is that of optimization: many methods can be cast in the language of optimization techniques, allowing the transfer to neural nets of detailed results about computational complexity and safety procedures to ensure convergence and to avoid numerical problems. The review is not intended to deliver detailed prescriptions for the most appropriate methods in specific applications, but to illustrate the main characteristics of the different methods and their mutual relations.},
