@ARTICLE{mccu_pitt,
  title     = "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity",
  author    = "McCulloch, Warren S and Pitts, Walter",
  abstract  = "Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity,
               neural events and the relations among them can be treated by
               means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of
               every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of
               more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and
               that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions,
               one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is
               shown that many particular choices among possible
               neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that
               for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists
               another net which behaves under the other and gives the same
               results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various
               applications of the calculus are discussed.",
